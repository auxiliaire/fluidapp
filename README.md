# FluidApp

Cross-platform 2D Fluid Simulation application, written entirely in C and GTK4, developed on Linux/Windows.

The fluid simulation algorithm is based on Jos Stam's [famous paper](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Fall09/papers/StamFluidforGames.pdf), with only minor modifications and extensions.

The goal was to create an easy-to-use user interface to modify the variables of the algorithm and make playing with fluid simulation more accessible.

## Development

The app is still in development. More features, fixes, build instructions are yet to come.
